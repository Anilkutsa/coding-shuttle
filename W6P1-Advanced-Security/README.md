# 1. Refresh Token vs Access Token

## Issues with JWT Access Tokens

#### 1. Increased Risk with Long-Lived Tokens
If an access token is used for an extended period, its exposure in requests increases the risk of it being intercepted or misused. Short-lived tokens reduce this risk by limiting how long a stolen token can be exploited. However, short-lived tokens alone are not a complete solution.

#### 2. Frequent Reauthentication Disrupts User Experience
Since access tokens are typically short-lived, users may need to reauthenticate frequently if a refresh token mechanism is not implemented. This can disrupt the user experience and reduce overall convenience.

---

### Solution: Two-Token Approach
To address these challenges, a two-token approach is recommended:

#### 1. Access Token
- **Purpose**: Grants short-term access to protected resources.
- **Characteristics**: Short-lived to minimize risk if intercepted. Typically stored in memory or as a client-side variable.

#### 2. Refresh Token
- **Purpose**: Used to obtain a new access token when the old one expires.
- **Characteristics**: Long-lived and securely stored (e.g., in HTTP-only cookies). Only transmitted during the token renewal process, reducing its exposure.

---

By combining access tokens for frequent, secure resource access and refresh tokens for extended user sessions, this approach ensures both security and convenience in JWT-based authentication systems.

# Access Token and Refresh Token Implementation in Spring Boot

This document provides a step-by-step explanation of implementing access tokens and refresh tokens in a Spring Boot application to ensure secure and efficient authentication mechanisms.

## Overview

1. **Access Token**: A short-lived token used for accessing protected resources.
2. **Refresh Token**: A long-lived token used to obtain a new access token when the old one expires.

The application uses Spring Boot with JWT (JSON Web Token) for token-based authentication.

---

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Implement `AuthController`

The `AuthController` provides endpoints for user signup, login, and token refresh.

#### Key Endpoints:

- **`/auth/signup`**: Allows users to create an account.
- **`/auth/login`**: Authenticates the user and provides access and refresh tokens.
- **`/auth/refresh`**: Generates a new access token using the refresh token stored in cookies.

### 2. Create necessary methods in `AuthService`

The `AuthService` handles user login and token refresh logic. In our case, we have created two methods `login()` and `refreshToken` which help generate access/refresh token and return that in `LoginResponseDto` format.

### 3. Implement the `JwtService`

The `JwtService` generates and validates JWTs. In our case, we have added 2 new methods namely `generateAccessToken()` and `generateRefreshToken()` that help generate Jwt tokens with data and expiration dates.

### 4. Test the Application

Please test the application using `/auth/login` and  `/auth/refresh` API's. Reduce the expiry time of access and refresh token for the purpose of testing.

# 2. Google OAuth2 Client Authentication in Spring Security

This section explains how Google OAuth2 authentication works using your code implementation as a reference.

## Workflow of Google OAuth2 Authentication
Google OAuth2 is an authentication mechanism that allows users to log in using their Google account. It involves the following steps:

<img src="./assets/google-oauth-workflow.png" alt="Spring Security Flow" width="1000">

## Key Components in Your Implementation

### 1. **Security Configuration**

The `WebSecurityConfig` class configures security settings and integrates OAuth2 login.

```java

public class WebSecurityConfig {

    private final OAuth2SuccessHandler oAuth2SuccessHandler;

    @Bean
    SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity httpSecurity) throws Exception {
        httpSecurity
                ...
                .oauth2Login(oauth2Config -> oauth2Config
                        .failureUrl("/login?error=true")
                        .successHandler(oAuth2SuccessHandler)
                );
        return httpSecurity.build();
    }
}
```
- **OAuth2 Success Handler**: The `oAuth2SuccessHandler` processes successful authentication requests.
- **JWT Authentication**: The `JwtAuthFilter` validates JWTs for secured routes.

### 2. **OAuth2SuccessHandler**

The `OAuth2SuccessHandler` handles successful authentication by:
- Retrieving user details from Google.
- Checking if the user exists in the local database; if not, creating a new user.
- Generating JWT access and refresh tokens.
- Redirecting to the frontend with the access token.

# 3. User Session management using JWT

User session management refers to the practice of maintaining and controlling user interactions with an application over a period of time. It involves tracking and managing user login sessions, ensuring security, and providing a seamless user experience.

---

## JWT Session management:
1. Generate ACCESS-TOKEN + REFRESH-TOKEN and store the Session using this schema 
   - `(session_id, refreshToken, userId, lastUsedAt)`
2. When renewing ACCESS-TOKEN using REFRESH-TOKEN
   - if REFRESH-TOKEN is not expired AND the session is present, return ACCESS-TOKEN
   - if session is NOT present, return Exception
3. Upon a New Login request, check if the session limit is full. 
   - if full -> remove the least recently used session 
   - else -> Follow step 1

---
## Session Workflow

<img src="./assets/session-workflow.png" alt="Spring Security Flow" width="1000">

---

## Components and Logic

### 1. **SessionService**
Handles session generation and validation logic.

#### **Methods**:

- **`generateNewSession(User user, String refreshToken)`**:
    - Creates a new session for the user.
    - If the user exceeds the session limit (default: 2), deletes the least recently used session.
    - Saves the new session to the database.

- **`validateSession(String refreshToken)`**:
    - Checks if the provided refresh token exists in the database.
    - Updates the `lastUsedAt` timestamp for the session if valid.
    - Throws `SessionAuthenticationException` if the session is invalid.

---

### 2. **SessionRepository**
A JPA repository for managing session entities in the database.

---

### 3. **Session Entity**
Defines the `Session` object with attributes such as `refreshToken`, `lastUsedAt`, and a relationship with the `User` entity.

---

### 4. **AuthService**
Handles authentication, session generation, and token-based authorization.

#### **Methods**:

- **`login(LoginDto loginDto)`**:
    - Authenticates the user using `AuthenticationManager`.
    - Generates access and refresh tokens.
    - Creates a new session using `SessionService.generateNewSession()`.

- **`refreshToken(String refreshToken)`**:
    - Validates the refresh token using `SessionService.validateSession()`.
    - Generates a new access token.
    - Fails to create refreshToken if session data does not exist

---

## Summary
This implementation ensures:
- **Session Limitation**: Prevents users from exceeding a predefined number of active sessions.
- **Session Validation**: Validates and updates session activity for secure refresh token usage.
- **Scalability**: Easily extendable to support more advanced session management features.

# 4. Role Based Authorization

## Authentication vs Authorization 
- **`Authentication`** is the process of verifying the identity of a user. It ensures that the user is who they claim to be. Authentication typically involves validating credentials, such as a username and password, and creating a security context for the user. 
- **`Authorization`** is the process of determining whether an authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access a particular resource or perform an action. It controls what an authenticated user can or cannot do. 

### Who are youâ€“ Authentication 
### What can you do - Authorization

## Components and Logic

## Overview
RBAC ensures that only authorized users with specific roles can access certain resources or perform particular actions. The implemented roles in this application are:

- **USER**: Basic access.
- **CREATOR**: Can create resources (e.g., posts).
- **ADMIN**: Full access to manage resources and users.

---

## Components and Logic

### 1. **User Entity**
The `User` entity implements `UserDetails` from Spring Security to integrate with Spring's authentication framework.

#### Code:
```java
@Entity
public class User implements UserDetails {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    ...

    @ElementCollection(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private Set<Role> roles;

    @Override
    public Collection<? extends GrantedAuthority> getAuthorities() {
        return roles.stream()
                .map(role -> new SimpleGrantedAuthority("ROLE_" + role.name()))
                .collect(Collectors.toSet());
    }
    ...
}
```

### 2. **Role Enum**
Defines the available roles in the application.

#### Code:
```java
public enum Role {
    USER,
    CREATOR,
    ADMIN
}
```

### 3. **WebSecurityConfig**
Configures security settings to apply role-based access to endpoints.

#### Code:
```java
@Configuration
public class WebSecurityConfig {

    @Bean
    SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity httpSecurity) throws Exception {
        httpSecurity
                .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
                        .requestMatchers(publicRoutes).permitAll()
                        .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.GET, "/posts/**").permitAll()
                        .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.POST, "/posts/**")
                            .hasAnyRole(Role.ADMIN.name(), Role.CREATOR.name())
                        .anyRequest().authenticated())
                ...
                );
        return httpSecurity.build();
    }
}
```

### Summary
This implementation ensures:
1. **Role-Based Authorization**: Protects endpoints based on user roles.
2. **Granular Permissions**: Allows fine-grained access control (e.g., only `CREATOR` and `ADMIN` can create posts).
3. **Scalable Design**: Easily extendable to add more roles and permissions as needed.

---

# 5. Granular Authorization with Authority 

## Role vs Authority

- Roles represent high-level, permissions that are typically associated with a group of users. For example, `USER`, `ADMIN`, `MANAGER` etc.
- Authorities, also known as privileges or permissions, represent finegrained access rights within an application. For example, different authorities can be defined to allow users to `CREATE`, `UPDATE` AND `DELETE` a particular resource. `POST_CREATE`, `POST_UPDATE`, `POST_DELETE`, `BLOG_CREATE`, `BLOG_UPDATE`, `BLOG_DELETE`.

---

## Role Implementation 

We have defined all our roles in `/entities/enums/Role.java` class.

#### Role (Entities/Enum)

```java
public enum Role {
    USER,
    CREATOR,
    ADMIN
}
```

#### User (Entity)
- We assign roles to a user during the time of his entity creation.
- User entity class implements UserDetails interface which overrides `getAuthorities()` method. We return the list of all the roles that a user has through `SimpleGrantedAuthority` object through `getAuthorities()` method. 

```java
public class User implements UserDetails {
    ...
    
    @ElementCollection(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private Set<Role> roles;

    @Override
    public Collection<? extends GrantedAuthority> getAuthorities() {
        return roles.stream()
                .map(role -> new SimpleGrantedAuthority("ROLE_"+role.name()))
                .collect(Collectors.toSet());
    }
    ...
}
```

#### WebSecurityConfig

- Define paths user can access based on the his role inside config class

```java
public class WebSecurityConfig {
    ...
    @Bean
    SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity httpSecurity) throws Exception {
        httpSecurity
                .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
                        .requestMatchers(publicRoutes).permitAll()
                        .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.GET, "/posts/**").permitAll()
                        .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.POST, "/posts/**")
                            .hasAnyRole(ADMIN.name(), CREATOR.name())
                        .anyRequest().authenticated())
                ...
                );
        return httpSecurity.build();
    }
```
---

## Permission Implementation (Naive)

#### Permission (Entities/Enum)

```java
public enum Permission {

    POST_VIEW,
    POST_CREATE,
    POST_UPDATE,
    POST_DELETE,

    USER_VIEW,
    USER_CREATE,
    USER_UPDATE,
    USER_DELETE

}
```

#### SignUpDto (dto)
Start accepting list of permissions for a user in the API
```java
@Data
public class SignUpDto {
    private String email;
    private String password;
    private String name;
    private Set<Role> roles;
    private Set<Permission> permissions;
}
```

#### User (Entity)
- Now you can pass permissions that a user has along with a role

```java
import org.springframework.security.core.authority.SimpleGrantedAuthority;

public class User implements UserDetails {
    ...

    @ElementCollection(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private Set<Role> roles;

    @ElementCollection(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private Set<Permission> permissions;

    @Override
    public Collection<? extends GrantedAuthority> getAuthorities() {
        Set<SimpleGrantedAuthority> authorities = roles.stream()
                .map(role -> new SimpleGrantedAuthority("ROLE_" + role.name()))
                .collect(Collectors.toSet());

        permissions.stream().forEach(
                permission -> authorities.add(new SimpleGrantedAuthority((permission.name()))));
        
        return authorities;
    }
    ...
}
```

#### WebSecurityConfig

- Define actions user can perform based on his authorities (permissions) inside config class

```java
import com.codingshuttle.sample.w6p1_advanced_security.entities.enums.Permission;

public class WebSecurityConfig {
    ...

    @Bean
    SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity httpSecurity) throws Exception {
        httpSecurity
                .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
                        ...
                        .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.POST, "/posts/**")
                            .hasAnyRole(ADMIN.name(), CREATOR.name())
                        .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.POST, "/posts/**")
                            .hasAnyAuthority(Permission.POST_DELETE.name(), Permission.POST_UPDATE.name())
                        .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.DELETE, "/posts/**")
                            .hasAuthority(Permission.POST_DELETE.name())
                        .anyRequest().authenticated())
                ...
                );
        return httpSecurity.build();
    }
```

---

## Permission Optimisation - 1

#### PermissionMapping (Utils)
- Set a mapping between user role and permission in utils package and return SET of permissions given a role

```java
public class PermissionMapping {

    private static final Map<Role, Set<Permission>> map = Map.of(
            USER, Set.of(USER_VIEW, POST_VIEW),
            CREATOR, Set.of(POST_CREATE, USER_UPDATE, POST_UPDATE),
            ADMIN, Set.of(POST_CREATE, USER_UPDATE, POST_UPDATE, USER_DELETE, USER_CREATE, POST_DELETE)
    );

    public static Set<SimpleGrantedAuthority> getAuthoritiesForRole(Role role) {
        return map.get(role).stream()
                .map(permission -> new SimpleGrantedAuthority(permission.name()))
                .collect(Collectors.toSet());
    }

}
```

#### User (Entity)

- Given a user role, use PermissionMapping to get permissions for the role and return the list

```java
public class User implements UserDetails {
    ....
    @Override
    public Collection<? extends GrantedAuthority> getAuthorities() {
        Set<SimpleGrantedAuthority> authorities = new HashSet<>();
        roles.forEach(
                role -> {
                    Set<SimpleGrantedAuthority> permissions = PermissionMapping.getAuthoritiesForRole(role);
                    authorities.addAll(permissions);
                    authorities.add(new SimpleGrantedAuthority("ROLE_"+role.name()));
                }
        );
        return authorities;
    }
```

### Drawbacks of this approach

- Permissions are tightly coupled with Roles
- Not optimal when you application starts growing beyond a certain point

# 6. Security Method Annotations - @Secured and @PreAuthorize

In a Spring Boot application, security method annotations such as @Secured and @PreAuthorize are used to enforce security constraints at the method level. These annotations define the roles or permissions required to access specific methods, providing fine-grained security controls for your application.

## **@Secured Annotation**
   - **Purpose:** Specifies security roles (authorities) required to invoke a method.
   - **Configuration:** It is a part of Spring Security and needs to be enabled by adding @EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(securedEnabled = true) in your configuration class.
   - **Usage:**
     - You annotate methods and specify one or more roles required to access them.
     - If the current user does not have the specified role(s), an AccessDeniedException is thrown.

```java
@Secured("ROLE_ADMIN")
public void adminOnlyMethod() {
    // Method accessible only by users with "ROLE_ADMIN"
}

@Secured({"ROLE_USER", "ROLE_MANAGER"})
public void userOrManagerMethod() {
    // Method accessible by users with "ROLE_USER" or "ROLE_MANAGER"
}
```

## Code implementation 

- Let's suppose we want user with `USER/ADMIN` role to view all posts. You can do that by declaring below annotation. 
- Please mind to add `@EnableMethodSecurity(securedEnabled = true)` in config class before using this.


```java
    @GetMapping
    @Secured({"ROLE_USER", "ROLE_ADMIN"})
    public List<PostDTO> getAllPosts() {
        return postService.getAllPosts();
    }
```

Also, since we are delighting the control at method level, we don't need to define rules inside `WebSecurityConfig`.

```java
public class WebSecurityConfig {
    ...
    @Bean
    SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity httpSecurity) throws Exception {
                httpSecurity
                .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
                        .requestMatchers(publicRoutes).permitAll()
                        .requestMatchers("/posts/**").authenticated()
                        .anyRequest().authenticated())
                .csrf(csrfConfig -> csrfConfig.disable())
                ...
                );

        return httpSecurity.build();
    }
```

### Limitations:
- Only works with roles (not fine-grained expressions).
- not handle complex security logic or conditions.

---

## @PreAuthorize Annotation
   - **Purpose:** Allows more complex security expressions using Spring Expression Language (SpEL).
   - **Configuration:** Requires enabling with @EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true) in the configuration class.
   - **Usage:**
     - Annotate methods with SpEL expressions to define security constraints.
     - Provides greater flexibility than @Secured.

```java
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN')")
public void adminOnlyMethod() {
    // Method accessible only by users with "ROLE_ADMIN"
}

@PreAuthorize("hasAnyRole('ROLE_USER', 'ROLE_MANAGER')")
public void userOrManagerMethod() {
    // Method accessible by users with either "ROLE_USER" or "ROLE_MANAGER"
}

@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('VIEW_REPORTS') and #id == authentication.principal.id")
public void viewReport(Long id) {
    // Method accessible if the user has "VIEW_REPORTS" authority and their ID matches the given ID
}
```

## Code implementation

1. Define security rule for Posts like shown below in `utils/PostSecurity.java` class.

```java
@Component
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class PostSecurity {

    private  final PostService postService;

    public boolean isOwnerOfPost(Long postId) {
        User user = (User) SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getPrincipal();
        PostDTO post = postService.getPostById(postId);
        return post.getAuthor().getId().equals(user.getId());
    }
}
```

2. Add `author` field for Post in DTO and Entity classes.
3. Add necessary condition in PostController class.

```java
public class PostController {
    ...
    @GetMapping("/{postId}")
    @PreAuthorize("@postSecurity.isOwnerOfPost(#postId)")
    public PostDTO getPostById(@PathVariable Long postId) {
        return postService.getPostById(postId);
    }
    ...
}
```

Now, only posts created by Author will be shown when we request posts by id.

### Advantages:
- Can use authorities and roles interchangeably.
- Allows logical operators (and, or, not).
- Supports dynamic expressions, e.g., checking user attributes or method arguments.
